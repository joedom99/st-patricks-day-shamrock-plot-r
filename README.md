# Three-Leaf Shamrock in R

This repository contains an R script that uses **ggplot2** to create a three-leaf shamrock with a curved stemâ€”perfect for celebrating St. Patrick's Day. The script demonstrates 2D transformations (rotation and scaling) to generate and arrange the leaves, and it is fully documented for easy customization. I was inspired to create this based on earlier work from Natalie Patten who created an animated four leaf clover in R about 10 years ago. You can see Natalie's version here - https://www.summitllc.us/blog/using-r-for-data-visualizations-st.-patricks-day-edition

## Requirements

- R (version 3.6 or higher)
- ggplot2 package

## Explanation

The R script is well documented so that you can see what it's doing. I recommend running this in R Studio.
